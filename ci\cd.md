### WEEK-2
#### CI/CD
**what is ci/cd?**
Continous integeration and continous deployment is two different things. 

Continous integeration takes care of code when commit and it runs test. While contionus 
deployment takes care of build, release and bugs. 

**Whats the use of ci/cd?**

before ci/cd code get checked once in a day in midnight. And because of that there were many 
conflicts and bugs. As there were many developers working on the same code. 
With ci/cd codes get test directly after the commit and developer were immediately informed about 
their bugs. 

Due to this companies can release product on the promised time and generates more profit. 
ci/cd is an automation process, a journey of code from developers to production. Code can get 
checked very often so it can be a healthy practice to perform. 


There are many tools for ci/cd: But famous are **jenkins** and circle ci

Jenikins is the server based architecture written in java. 
Though jenkins ui is not very good but it is famous because of its vibrant community and lot of 
contributors contributing into it. 

Also jenkins installation requires some manual process and with the small change the pipeline get 
broken but developers love just hides this cons. 

I have learned how to integerate jenkins with github, how to install jenkins and how to add new 
users.

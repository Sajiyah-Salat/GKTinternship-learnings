### Version Control with Git

**What is Git and Github?** 

git is a cli tool that save or conserve your code when you upoload your code regularly git 
takes care of all the history like when and who change and what’s the code that changed. 
Github is a ui tool where you can post your copies of code to basically work with developers 
around the world. The basic idea of github during its invention by Scot chacon and other 
developers was the same. 


We can make our profile on github and make open source contribuitons. People outside india believe 
that you dont need a resume if you have a strong github profile. 

As a DevOps enginneer git is the basic tool to learn and its our job to maintain the code.
 
Github also provides us with simple solution to ci/cd which is again a very important skill for a 
devops enginner which is github actions.

Through github actions you can test your code automatically and publish it directly to github. 
These are simple commands which github use:

git status: To track any change in the repository
git clone: to copy code from remote to local pc
git add . : To stage the commit 
commit: When you made changes you need to add a line describing your change which github
save for future reference. 
Git commit -m “ first commit”: You can add your message in between these commas

git works in three satge:
First to stage your change 
Second to commit your  change
Third to push your change easily with the command “git push -u origin main

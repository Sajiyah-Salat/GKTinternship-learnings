### Introduction to DevOps
**What is DevOps?**
DevOps word is the combination of developer and Operations. 
Every company have two crucial pillars Developer team who build the code. 

operation team who focus on the overall operations of a specific area of 
business. Sometimes when application shuts down completely. 
There would be a blame game between operation team and developer team. 
To prevent this downtime and blame war. 
Companies come with a new approach called devops
enginner who collabarates between developer and operations and prevent 
application to hit down time. 
Before devops applications takes months to deploy so the update or release 
from the company to customer was too low. 
Because of that when company come up with new release, they were tension and fear of application to go 
down because of new changes. 
But when concept of devops and microservice was introduced. Companies can deploy and deliever thier application 90% 
faster than traditional process. 
In simple devops is the process to deliver code with much faster rate and 
without hitting the downtime. 


Stages of DevOps: after getting tested code from a developer and code get 
dockerized and then send to kubernetes to deploy.
 To make this workflow smooth we have ci/cd which makes pipeline to delever code. All this things 
works on cloud as most of the companies are shifting to cloud because of 
expenses. 
To run the same configuration in 1000s of server at once. 
We have ansible. And for preventing application to hit the downtime we have monitoring
tools like prometheus, graffana. To give a structure a whole look we have Iac 
tool like terraform from hashicorp.
